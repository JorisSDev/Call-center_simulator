# Call-center_simulator
A python program that simulates a work enviroment of a call center. This project was done as part of the data structures and algorithms course. 


A menu allows you to generate calls that get placed into a line, executed utilizing the deck data structure. Regular calls get placed at the back, VIP calls in the front. They are generated from a list of contact in the data.xlsx file and after being accepted and the call has ended, they get placed in the output.xlsx file.

-------------------------------------
    [0] :: Stop work (back to start menu)
    [1] :: Still running(skip)
    [2] :: Chance for call (can be easily configured to any %)
    [3] :: Accept call/Decline call (if accepted, gets placed in the database, if declined, gets popped)
